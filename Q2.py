"""
A situation I have helped people with a lot at UVA is this. A student (usually a grad student) starts in a research group and is handed some code from a previous 
grad student. Sometimes the code is well documented. Often times it is not. Let's say that you have inherited such code and now need to make sense of it and eventually use it. Where do you begin?

Places to start:
    -Ask the AI to give you a summary of what the file does
    -Try to run the file and follow up on any error messages
    -Ask the AI to thoroughly comment and document this file for your own understanding
    -Ask if there is any refactoring or simplification of the code that is possible
    -Ask AI to write a README file to make life easier for future users
