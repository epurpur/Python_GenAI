    "This workshop is built on experiences I've had working with people at UVA on research projects. It is one thing to have a GenAI tool write some code for you. It is another to get it to write good code for you. Keep in mind, you (the human) are in control of the situation and need to guide Copilot, ChatGPT, or whatever AI tool needed to the correct results. Leveraging GenAI to help you write code can be a huge time saver if you know how to do it correctly."
